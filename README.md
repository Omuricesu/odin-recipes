Hi, this is just a simple file that is utilizing basic html to create a webpage.

This project is used to demonstrate the simple html edits and attributes that can be used to make a web page.
 
It currently does not use CSS styling.

Additionally, these files will be utilized to practice different commits and githubs overall learning best practices.
